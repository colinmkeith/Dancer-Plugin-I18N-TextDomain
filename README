Dancer-Plugin-I18N-TextDomain

A plugin to allow Dancer apps to use multilingual support via gettext.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

Tricky things to watch are that;

1. Locale::TextDomain (L::TD) uses the package of the caller to determine the
textdomain. This is tricky because when you set this up using set_i18n_domain()
the caller is this plugin, Dancer::Plugin::I18N::TextDomain. When you call it
from your script then the caller is the package from which you call it. For
example My::App.

To fix this calls to the gettext functions are routed through a simply sub
called tdcore() which changes into the Dancer::Plugin::I18N::TextDomain package
space before calling the appropriate gettext function.

2. When the __*x() gettext methods are called from inside of TT, e.g.

[% __x('hello {name}', name=>'world'); %]

TT tries to be helpful and pass the parameters as a hash. This isn't actually
helpful since L::TD expects to receive a hash instead of a hashref. The effect
is that you get warnings in Dancer about odd numbers of elements in the hash:

Warning caught during route execution: Odd number of elements in hash assignment at .../Locale/TextDomain.pm line 146.

To stop this tdcore() dereferences a hashref passed as the last element of @_
if the gettext method is a __*x() method. You can avoid it in TT by using


[% __x('hello {name}', 'name', 'world'); %]

But that is more typing and harder to read.


Suggestions on better solutions to either of these are welcome.
